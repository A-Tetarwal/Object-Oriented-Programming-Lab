# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Lab Files

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) lab files repository! This collection of code showcases various OOPs concepts implemented throughout the course. Each lab assignment explores fundamental principles of OOPs, contributing to a solid understanding of object-oriented programming.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Lab 1: Introduction to OOP**
   - Basic concepts of classes and objects.

2. **Lab 2: Classes and Objects**
   - Further exploration of classes, objects, and their attributes/methods.

3. **Lab 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Implementation of inheritance and polymorphism for code reusability and flexibility.

4. **Lab 4: Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - Utilization of encapsulation and abstraction to hide implementation details and simplify complex systems.
